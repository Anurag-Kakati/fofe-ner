( EB ) .\nVan Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm \'s margins .\nHe said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .\nBut he said the company \'s investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .\nSome analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market \'s overcapacity .\n" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I \'m speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ...\nI think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , " he said .\nVan Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec \'s potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .\nHe said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country \'s largest-selling brand .\n" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , " van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland .\nVan Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm \'s overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .\n-- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700\n', 'entities': [['T0', 'FN-MISC', [[0, 16]]], ['T1', 'PER', [[43, 56]]], ['T2', 'LOC', [[57, 63]]], ['T3', 'ORG', [[89, 95]]], ['T4', 'MISC', [[75, 81]]], ['T5', 'PER', [[323, 339]]], ['T6', 'ORG', [[345, 352]]], ['T7', 'ORG', [[624, 630]]], ['T8', 'FP-ORG', [[674, 682]]], ['T9', 'FP-ORG', [[652, 671]]], ['T10', 'FN-ORG', [[652, 682]]], ['T11', 'PER', [[790, 801]]], ['T12', 'MISC', [[896, 902]]], ['T13', 'MISC', [[1166, 1172]]], ['T14', 'PER', [[1150, 1157]]], ['T15', 'LOC', [[1394, 1401]]], ['T16', 'LOC', [[1352, 1358]]], ['T17', 'LOC', [[1406, 1413]]], ['T18', 'LOC', [[1310, 1316]]], ['T19', 'PER', [[1416, 1427]]], ['T20', 'LOC', [[1433, 1439]]], ['T21', 'ORG', [[1653, 1659]]], ['T22', 'ORG', [[1685, 1693]]], ['T23', 'ORG', [[1700, 1709]]], ['T24', 'FP-LOC', [[1733, 1739]]], ['T25', 'FN-ORG', [[1733, 1739]]], ['T26', 'ORG', [[2028, 2030]]], ['T27', 'LOC', [[1922, 1931]]], ['T28', 'ORG', [[1845, 1850]]], ['T29', 'ORG', [[1836, 1840]]], ['T30', 'LOC', [[1974, 1980]]], ['T31', 'ORG', [[1790, 1793]]], ['T32', 'ORG', [[2003, 2025]]], ['T33', 'FP-MISC', [[1760, 1773]]], ['T34', 'FP-ORG', [[1935, 1943]]], ['T35', 'FP-ORG', [[1774, 1787]]], ['T36', 'FN-ORG', [[1935, 1946]]], ['T37', 'FN-ORG', [[1760, 1787]]], ['T38', 'ORG', [[2088, 2094]]], ['T39', 'PER', [[2035, 2046]]], ['T40', 'LOC', [[2475, 2489]]], ['T41', 'ORG', [[2586, 2591]]], ['T42', 'LOC', [[2562, 2568]]], ['T43', 'FP-PER', [[2627, 2638]]], ['T44', 'FP-MISC', [[2535, 2540]]], ['T45', 'FP-MISC', [[2691, 2696]]], ['T46', 'FN-LOC', [[2691, 2696]]], ['T47', 'FN-LOC', [[2535, 2540]]], ['T48', 'FN-PER', [[2631, 2638]]], ['T49', 'MISC', [[2737, 2743]]], ['T50', 'FP-MISC', [[2943, 2948]]], ['T51', 'FN-LOC', [[2943, 2948]]], ['T52', 'ORG', [[3127, 3135]]], ['T53', 'PER', [[2969, 2980]]], ['T54', 'ORG', [[3057, 3066]]], ['T55', 'ORG', [[2986, 2992]]], ['T56', 'ORG', [[3093, 3099]]], ['T57', 'FP-LOC', [[3008, 3014]]], ['T58', 'FN-ORG', [[3008, 3014]]], ['T59', 'ORG', [[3271, 3277]]], ['T60', 'FN-MISC', [[3278, 3288]]], ['T61', 'ORG', [[3499, 3507]]], ['T62', 'LOC', [[3544, 3550]]], ['T63', 'PER', [[3472, 3479]]], ['T64', 'MISC', [[3410, 3416]]], ['T65', 'ORG', [[3575, 3581]]], ['T66', 'PER', [[3553, 3564]]], ['T67', 'ORG', [[3785, 3800]]]]};

Newmont , announced Thursday .\nWall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .\nNewmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .\nAnalysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer .\nThey said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term .\nNewmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .\nAny deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said .\nAnalysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia \'s Busang vast gold deposit .\nPlacer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe \'s Nevada , South America and Central Asia presence , they said .\nA Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list .\nHomestake , based in San Francisco , operates gold mines in the United States , Australia , Chile and Canada .\nEarnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million .\nSanta Fe is headquartered Albuquerque , N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million .\nSanta Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada , California , Montana , Canada , Brazil , Australia , Chile , Kazakstan , Mexico and Ghana .\nPaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion .\n" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number .\nOne would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone , " he said .\n" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things .\nBut in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " the analyst added .\nNewmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares .\nIn Friday New York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 .\n" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for \' We have more money in our pocket , \' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont .\nTwo other arbs called Newmont \'s move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only the

"\nA controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .\nBrazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy .\nThere are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP .\nEvery year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there .\nHakme attributes Brazil \'s fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country \'s mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "\nWhat happens is the nose sometimes does n\'t match the mouth or the buttocks do n\'t match with the legs , " he said .\nBrazil \'s most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .\nStomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .\n" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , " SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said .

International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) had been barred from speaking at next week \'s WTO meeting in Singapore .\nBill Jordan , general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( ICFTU ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was " outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world " .\nJordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links .\n" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , " Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade .\nThe three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda .\nJordan said the WTO \'s credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour .\nThe ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union .\nBill Brett , chairman of the ILO Workers Group , told Reuters before the news conference he was " not too surprised , but very disappointed " that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn .\n" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , " he said , adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda .\nASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam .\nThe ILO wants a trade and labour rights " social clause " included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization \'s first ministerial-level gathering .\nSpeaking to ICFTU delegates , Richard Eglin , director of the WTO secretariat , said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems .\nBut he said the WTO \'s organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO .\n', 'entities': [['T0', 'MISC', [[0, 7]]], ['T1', 'PER',

var dataX135 = {'text': 'FEATURE - Singapore sees prestige in hosting WTO .\nRamthan Hussain\nSINGAPORE 1996-12-06\nSingapore \'s winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) \'s first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said .\n" As one of the world \'s most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , " said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A .\n" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . "\nThe city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 .\nIn a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore \'s caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered .\nThat would have meant Geneva .\nBut Singapore had the support of other WTO members .\nDerek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore \'s hosting of the conference " carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . "\nThere is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore .\nAt the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) .\nIn June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector .\nSupple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .\n" There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .\nSupple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . "\nFrom a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore \'s tourism industry , Tan said .\nA large part of Singapore \'s workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " Tan said .\n" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . "\nSupple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .\n" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore \'s economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . "\nBut I do n\'t think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this .\nI think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed .
