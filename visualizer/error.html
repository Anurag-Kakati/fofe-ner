white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp .\nSanta Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday .\nWall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .\nNewmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .\nAnalysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer .\nThey said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term .\nNewmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .\nAny deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said .\nAnalysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia \'s Busang vast gold deposit .\nPlacer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe \'s Nevada , South America and Central Asia presence , they said .\nA Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list .\nHomestake , based in San Francisco , operates gold mines in the United States , Australia , Chile and Canada .\nEarnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million .\nSanta Fe is headquartered Albuquerque , N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million .\nSanta Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada , California , Montana , Canada , Brazil , Australia , Chile , Kazakstan , Mexico and Ghana .\nPaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion .\n" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number .\nOne would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone , " he said .\n" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things .\nBut in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " the analyst added .\nNewmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares .\nIn Friday New York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 .\n" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for \' We have more money in our pocket , \' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont .\nTwo other arbs called Newmont \'s move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only the

"\nWhat happens is the nose sometimes does n\'t match the mouth or the buttocks do n\'t match with the legs , " he said .\nBrazil \'s most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .\nStomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .\n" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , " SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said .

var dataX129 = {'text': 'FEATURE - Singapore sees prestige in hosting WTO .\nRamthan Hussain\nSINGAPORE 1996-12-06\nSingapore \'s winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) \'s first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said .\n" As one of the world \'s most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , " said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A .\n" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . "\nThe city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 .\nIn a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore \'s caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered .\nThat would have meant Geneva .\nBut Singapore had the support of other WTO members .\nDerek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore \'s hosting of the conference " carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . "\nThere is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore .\nAt the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) .\nIn June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector .\nSupple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .\n" There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .\nSupple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . "\nFrom a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore \'s tourism industry , Tan said .\nA large part of Singapore \'s workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " Tan said .\n" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . "\nSupple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .\n" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore \'s economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . "\nBut I do n\'t think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this .\nI think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed .
