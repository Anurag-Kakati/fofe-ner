1530\nCagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega .\nBottom team Reggiana are

Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury .\nNapoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330\nIn-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala .\nVerona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini .\nParma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330\nParma may field new

Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday .\nCagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530\nCagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega .\nBottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer .\nFiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330\nFiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and

.\nLazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930\nPoor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups .\nLazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack .\nAC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330\nCan Milan sink any further ?\nFollowing their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed .\nLiberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield .\nGood news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury .\nNapoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330\nIn-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala .\nVerona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini .\nParma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330\nParma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago .\nParma 's French midfielder

3 ) 1330\nAll-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack .\nThe new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle .\nVicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330\nNot exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless .\nFull strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws .\nInter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano .\n", 'entities': [['T0', 'MISC', [[9, 16]]], ['T1', 'LOC',

Thursday .\nWall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .\nNewmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .\nAnalysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival

in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .\nAny deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said .\nAnalysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and
